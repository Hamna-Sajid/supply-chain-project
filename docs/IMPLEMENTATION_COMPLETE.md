##  Missing Features Found & Implemented

### 1. Dashboard Metrics Aggregation 
**Problem:** Frontend displays KPI cards (Revenue, Expenses, Net Profit, Rating) but backend had no aggregation endpoint
**Solution:** Created `GET /api/supplier/dashboard` endpoint that:
- Queries delivered orders for revenue
- Sums expenses from expense table
- Calculates net profit (revenue - expenses)
- Retrieves average rating and count
- Returns pending orders count

### 2. Supplier Ratings Retrieval 
**Problem:** Frontend ratings section existed but no dedicated API endpoint
**Solution:** Created `GET /api/supplier/ratings` endpoint that:
- Fetches all ratings for supplier
- Joins with users table for rater names
- Calculates average and total count
- Returns complete rating details

### 3. Material Stock Overview 
**Problem:** Material stock chart needed top 5 materials by quantity
**Solution:** Created `GET /api/supplier/materials/stock/overview` endpoint that:
- Retrieves top 5 materials
- Sorts by quantity descending
- Optimized for chart rendering

### 4. Pending Orders Management 
**Problem:** Frontend showed pending orders table but no API to filter pending status
**Solution:** Created `GET /api/supplier/orders/pending` endpoint that:
- Filters orders by pending/processing status
- Includes manufacturer information
- Shows order dates and amounts
- Sorted by most recent

### 5. Delete Material Functionality 
**Problem:** Material management lacked delete endpoint
**Solution:** Created `DELETE /api/supplier/materials/:id` endpoint that:
- Removes material from supplier's catalog
- Verifies supplier ownership
- Returns confirmation

### 6. Enhanced Supply Logic 
**Problem:** Logic file lacked coordinated data loading functions
**Solution:** Added 7 new functions:
- `loadDashboardData()` - Dashboard metrics
- `loadPendingOrders()` - Orders table rendering
- `generateFinancialChart()` - Revenue/expense trends
- `generateMaterialStockChart()` - Material visualization
- `loadNotifications()` - Notification feed
- `showOrderDetails()` - Order details display
- Helper functions for data grouping

## 🔌 API Endpoints Added

```
GET /api/supplier/dashboard
  Returns: Revenue, Expenses, Net Profit, Avg Rating, Ratings Count, Pending Orders
  Auth: Required (Bearer token + Supplier role)

GET /api/supplier/ratings
  Returns: Array of ratings, average, total count with rater info
  Auth: Required (Bearer token + Supplier role)

GET /api/supplier/materials/stock/overview
  Returns: Top 5 materials by quantity
  Auth: Required (Bearer token + Supplier role)

DELETE /api/supplier/materials/:id
  Returns: Deletion confirmation
  Auth: Required (Bearer token + Supplier role)

GET /api/supplier/orders/pending
  Returns: Pending and processing orders with manufacturer info
  Auth: Required (Bearer token + Supplier role)
```

---

##  Security Implementation

 **All endpoints require authentication**
  - Bearer token validation
  - Role-based authorization (Supplier only)

 **Data isolation enforced**
  - Suppliers can only access their own data
  - Every query filtered by supplier_id

 **SQL injection prevention**
  - All queries use parameterized statements
  - No string concatenation in SQL

 **Error handling**
  - Try-catch blocks throughout
  - No sensitive data in error messages
  - Proper HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 500)

---

##  Database Queries

### 1. Revenue Calculation
```sql
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(o.total_amount), 0) as total_revenue
FROM orders o
WHERE o.delivered_by = $1 AND o.order_status = 'delivered'
```

### 2. Expense Calculation
```sql
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(amount), 0) as total_expense
FROM expense WHERE user_id = $1
```

### 3. Rating Statistics
```sql
SELECT COALESCE(AVG(rating_value), 0) as avg_rating, COUNT(*) as total_ratings
FROM ratings WHERE given_to = $1
```

### 4. Material Stock Overview
```sql
SELECT material_name, quantity_available 
FROM raw_materials 
WHERE supplier_id = $1 
ORDER BY quantity_available DESC 
LIMIT 5
```

### 5. Pending Orders
```sql
SELECT o.order_id, o.total_amount, u.name as manufacturer_name, 
       o.order_status, o.order_date
FROM orders o
JOIN users u ON o.ordered_by = u.user_id
WHERE o.delivered_by = $1 AND o.order_status IN ('pending', 'processing')
ORDER BY o.order_date DESC
```

##  Testing Coverage

### Backend Endpoint Testing
```
 GET /dashboard returns correct metrics
 GET /ratings returns supplier ratings with average
 GET /materials/stock/overview returns top 5 materials
 GET /orders/pending filters pending orders correctly
 DELETE /materials/:id removes material
 All endpoints require proper authentication
 All endpoints verify data ownership
```

### Integration Testing
```
 Frontend calls all new endpoints
 Data flows correctly from database to UI
 Error responses handled properly
 Authentication enforced on all endpoints
 Supplier data isolation maintained
```

### Security Testing
```
 Unauthorized requests rejected (401)
 Wrong role access denied (403)
 SQL injection attempts fail
 Missing resources return 404
 Server errors return 500 with safe messages
```
